Verification Notes
* DReal is another SMT solver

Kind2
* Limit the inputs to certain bounds

Priorities
* Verifiy PID implementation in Kind2
* Find a way to implement something in Lustre, verify it in Kind, convert to Rust code, and port this generated code to embedded Rust.
    - Can be simple, like a Counter
    - Can Rust code generated by Kind2 be made into a Crate?
    - Can this Rust code be easily linked into a C program?

* Embedded Rust is not as valuable as initially thought. Don't implement peripheral drivers in Rust.
    - Use existing C drivers and controller

Add things to the repo more often. Does not need to be polished.
