February 8th Meeting with Galois (more of a check-in)

- Next steps
	1) Model the motors, design PID controllers around this model
	2) Test for robustness
		-> How many amps can it deviate?
	3) Test motors for real-world parameters
		-> Find torque
		-> Response
		-> Current draw
	4) Look for mathematical models of motors in controls textbooks
		-> Some books
			1. Feedback Control of a Dynamic Systems by Gene Franklin
			2. Modern Control Theory by Babnicki
			3. Automatic Control Systems by Coo
	5) RiscV isn't ready, use STM32 Discovery board instead
